# Music of the Ancient Era

Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the Ancient Era with this music!

It is recommended to use this music mod when your civilization is in the Ancient Era. To do this, after downloading the mod, simply mark it as a "Permanent audiovisual mod" in the mod manager. However, do not enable this mod during the creation of a new game! Once your civilization advances to the Classical Era, simply unmark this mod as 'Permanent audiovisual mod' in the mod manager!

The music was created using Suno AI and then processed by me. Since the game is free, the music can be distributed within it for non-commercial use!

If you enjoyed the music, you can visit the mod’s page on GitHub. There, you’ll find a link to the playlist on Suno! On Suno, you can listen to the tracks in the proper order (with a structured narrative), view the track covers, give a thumbs-up, and increase the play count!

I plan to create music for every era that exists in the Unciv. In the future, links to music mods for each era will be added below.

1. Music of the Ancient Era: this mod.

2. Music of the Classical Era: coming soon.
